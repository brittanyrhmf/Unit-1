ðŸ¤” You have started developing a game for the local game shop owner. Consider the process so far and the next three weeks of development and testing. Create a file in your repository called task_1.md and solve the following questions. 

Question 1: Do you think it is necessary to involve the show owner during the process along the three weeks? Or alternatively, is it better to involve him only when the product is finished? Explain your answer
Watch this video about Minimal Viable Products
Question 2: Do you think it is necessary to create MVPs for your game? If so, what would some of the MPV look like and what do you expect to obtain from the client?

Answer: Yes it is necessary, so that the owner actually sees the progress that is being made on the product. This will also allow them to give his advice or say if there is something that they donâ€™t like about it so we can change it straight away while still in the making process.
MVPs will be useful in my Quiz game, for example maybe just entering one question and see if the program and the score counting works, and then adding more and more questions as we go.


Question 3: Do you see similarities between the Human-Centered Design cycle presented in the video and the Design Cycle we use for developing software? Explain.
 Answer: Sometimes, the Design cycle is very confusing and the users don't quite know how to use the program. The best thing to do in these cases would be to try to make the software more user friendly or give more precise commands on how to use the project. Feedback may also be given.
 
 Question 4: What are the simple principles for human-centered design presented in the video? Write a sentence with the definition of each.
Answer: 1 - Observation : 
- Idea generation
- prototyping
- Testing

Question 5: Consider your game. Think about ways you can improve the Playersâ€™ Experience using Human-centered design. Write below your ideas:
